# Decision Tree Classifier From Scratch

Decison Trees are one of the most widely used algorithms in the field and 
yet, it's foundations are simple and elegant that anyone who are a bit 
familiar with the machine learning can understand. 

So with this notebook, I've tried to explain what decision trees are, how 
to form a decision tree from scratch (From measuring impurity to choosing 
the best split and where to stop, I've tried to explain everything with 
examples!) without using sklearn. 

I hope it helps you understanding the concepts. And also, I've prepared 
all the material by myself and I'm also relatively new to the machine 
learning field. So if you think there are any mistakes our just not sure 
about something, feel free to contact with me! I'm looking forward to 
hear from you.

And finally, I've downloaded the dataset from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer).
